“Studyo - your study buddy to keep you on-track and productive”

The app I will be doing for this assignment is called Studyo. The name is a pun for “study” and “studio”. It means that the app will be a studio that includes all the tools you would ever need to succeed at your study.

Actually, not every tools. For now, my app has three functionality.
It has a pomodoro timer that can help you stay focus. (Pomodoro is a technique to stay focused by setting a timer to work on your tasks)
It has an assignment planner. 
Lastly, a statistic functionality.
